# Testing methodology. I am testing the primary methods for the find feature.
# To do this I have brought in a modified  method, find_test, which removes
# any return_to_menu calls, and replaces the write_to_file call with the line
# File.write("#{path[0..-5]}.txt", message) 

# I also have a modified find_feature method, find_feature_test 
# so that it directly takes a path variable when called
# that way the test does not rely on user input
# I have also added in error handling for: 
#   raise NotPngError unless path[-4..-1] == ".png"
#   raise FileMissing unless File.exist?(path)
# because these errors are normally checked in the get_filepath call 
# It calls find_test and checks to see if it finds a message 
# If it does it prints Success, if it fails it prints Fail

# I am then running a series of tests to see if it is working as intended.
# Tests include:
# Message not found
# Selecting a non .png file 
# Selecting a .png file that does not exist
# Message is hidden in image
