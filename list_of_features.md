### Feature 1: Hide message in an image
This feature allows the user to hide a message within an image and then save a new image with the message encoded. The application can only handle .png image files as the ChunkyPNG gem is used to handle image functions. Errors are handled if the wrong filetype is used, if the image file does not exist or if the message is too large to hide in the chosen image. 


### Feature 2: Find message in an image
This feature allows the user to find a message within an image and then gives the user the option to save the message in a text file. If no message is found the user is informed. In the current version SteggyHide is only able to find messages that have been hidden using SteggyHide. If there is a hidden message that was encoded by another method, they will not be found by SteggyHide. 


### Feature 3: Conversion Tools
